# Car License Plate Detection using YOLOv5 and EasyOCR

Utilizing machine learning and computer vision techniques to create a model that can correctly identify a car license plate from an image or video. 
We explore different techniques in object identification, and compare our model to technology that has been deployed in the real world.

## Motivation and Problem Significance

Manually extracting and identifying license plates can be very tedious and time consuming, especially given the vast amount of footage captured by surveillance cameras at intersections and the many vehicles that appear in each frame. However, this information is extremely valuable for various applications, such as monitoring traffic, locating stolen vehicles, tracking suspects, identifying unregistered cars, managing tolls, overseeing parking, and more. Developing a model capable of reading all license plates in a video or image, in partnership with police resources, such as stolen or missing vehicle databases, can help optimize the allocation of police resources and improve public safety.
